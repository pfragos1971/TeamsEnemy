# TeamsEnemy
A simple utility simulating user activity in Windows.

Have you ever being stressed while working from home after the COVID-19 era?
Who can monitor my work and why I have to apologize for because I wanted to have a break after all?

This is the enemy of MS Teams ensuring that you are always in a running process!

Have fun!!!
